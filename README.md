# Particle Tracker
Using a tutorial on ping-pong buffers and programming basic shaders (glsl) I extended it to become an interactive experience. Using a simple webcam to track movement it allowed me to control the cloud of particles that were produced by the shaders. Each of these particles has a randomly generated "personality" which affects their responsiveness and so the piece is slightly different every time it is run. I originally tried to use haar cascades for people tracking but it was too unstable, and so I created a simple difference tracking system instead. The project was displayed at a public art exhibition and required very stable lighting due to autoexposure noise produced by the camera, but it was enjoyed by many visitors. Essentially you make movements around the space and it feels like you are manipulating the cloud. It also samples a picture, in this case a yellow bird painted by my partner, and makes each particle take on the colour and position of the corresponding image pixel. When in a resting (not tracking) state the particles will stop following and try to return to their original position. It has been a wonderful learning experience and also extremely therapuetic to interact with; I improved my C++ as well as dipping a toe into shaders.
